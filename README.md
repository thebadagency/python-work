# python-work
Work to show my evolving skills with python.

#### WORK ADDED AS OF 07.25.2023 #####
I was requested to give a work sample of some data managment and analysis using Python and SQL.  My database had to be a sqlite db, along with an output csv from the results of my queries and or code.  I opted to use python3 that already has sqlite loaded into it and used Jupyter notebooks to do all of my work.  I completed this work sample using an Ubunutu VM provisioned through an Oracle VM VirtualBox.  This server already had python3, jupyter, pandas, and pip3 already loaded to it so I did not have to do any additional configuration to the server other than:
      - apt-get update
      - apt-get upgrade -y

Take a look at the code by checking out the Jupyter notebook: AchievementFirst.ipynb
Take a look at the Sqlite DB: ic.db
Take a look at the exported csv as a result of my queries and code: active_enrollment.csv
